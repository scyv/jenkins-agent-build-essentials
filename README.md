# Jenkins Agent with Build Essentials

This is an extended variant of the official jenkins/agent (https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/agent/) image but having installed the python3, build-essential, docToolchain and Graphviz packages.

This can be used for building projects with e.g. python and allows using the docToolchain for generating documents.
